Chat POC Application Overview

This is a Proof of Concept (POC) for a chat interface powered by Amazon Bedrock Agent Core with knowledge base integration. The application demonstrates the feasibility of conversational AI using Bedrock Agent Core with context-aware responses.

Key Features:
- Real-time Chat Interface: WebSocket-based chat with streaming responses
- Knowledge Base Integration: Context-aware responses from integrated knowledge bases  
- Session Management: Persistent chat sessions with message history
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- Scalable Architecture: Microservices architecture with Docker containers

Technology Stack:
- Backend: Go (idiomatic patterns, standard library)
- Frontend: Vue 3 Composition API + Tailwind CSS
- AI/ML: Amazon Bedrock Agent Core
- Data: MongoDB with vector support
- Infrastructure: Docker, Terraform, Kafka

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/sessions - Create new chat session
- GET /api/sessions/{id} - Get session details  
- WebSocket /api/chat - Real-time chat communication

Configuration:
The application requires the following environment variables:
- BEDROCK_AGENT_ID - Amazon Bedrock Agent ID
- BEDROCK_AGENT_ALIAS_ID - Agent Alias ID
- BEDROCK_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID - Knowledge Base ID
- AWS_REGION - AWS Region (us-east-1)

The application can be deployed using Docker Compose or Terraform for AWS infrastructure.
