Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base Test Document

This is a test document for validating the S3 Vectors ingestion workflow.

Key Information:
- Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers foundation models from leading AI companies.
- Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows.
- S3 Vectors storage provides cost-effective vector embeddings storage compared to OpenSearch Serverless.
- The typical cost for S3 Vectors is $5-10 per month versus $700 per month for OpenSearch Serverless.
- Vector embeddings are generated using models like Amazon Titan Embeddings G1.
- The Titan Embeddings G1 model produces 1536-dimensional vectors.
- Cosine distance metric is commonly used for semantic similarity calculations.

Technical Details:
- S3 Vectors uses standard S3 buckets with server-side encryption (AES-256).
- Vector indices are created with specific configurations for dimension, data type, and distance metric.
- The ingestion process converts documents into vector embeddings and stores them in S3.
- Queries use semantic search to find relevant document chunks based on vector similarity.

Benefits of S3 Vectors:
1. Cost savings: 99% reduction compared to OpenSearch Serverless
2. Seamless integration with Amazon Bedrock
3. No infrastructure management required
4. Sub-second query latency
5. Automatic scaling based on usage

This document should be successfully ingested and converted into vector embeddings for semantic search.
